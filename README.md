# Introducing HLFY
Notification Center widget giving you HealthKit insight presented with a twist. Project created at the Swift Crunch 8 event. 

## IDEA

* HealthKit data in a human readable way
* No numbers, no graphs
* Quick glance, easy to interpret
* Text only 
* Easy to share

## CHALLENGES

* Such new API, so few samples
* No access to HealthKit data directly inside widgets
* Generating interpreted data

## OUTCOME
